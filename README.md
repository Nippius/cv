# About

This repo contains my Curriculum Vitae. You are free modify it to create your own but please don't use my resume for anything else without my permission!

Do take a look to the [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template if you want to do more advanced stuff (like cover letters for example).

# How to build:

- Download [TeXLive](http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) and extract it's contents to a folder.

- Create a environment variable called TEXDIR with the value <path_to_text_live_bin_folder>

- Run build.ps1 to build all the documents.

- Run clean.ps1 to clean the builds (this deletes the output).

The output files are stored in the folder /output
